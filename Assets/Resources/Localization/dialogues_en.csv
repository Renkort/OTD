intro_1;Narrator;Wilkins was walking home late at night in the pouring rain.
intro_2; Narrator; He knew exactly what he would say to his mother when she asked me why he was late.
intro_3;Narrator; Mothers tend to get upset and worry about nothing. 
intro_4;Narrator; One day, Wilkins and a friend, in purely research interests, dug a deep hole in a neighbor's yard.
intro_5;Narrator; And old Mr. Harold fell into it and broke his knee.
intro_6;Narrator; Wilkins' mom made a whole story out of it, where he is the main villain, his friend is a malicious accomplice, and in general they are all criminals.
intro_7;Narrator; Yes, there was a case...
intro_8;Narrator; Hmm...
intro_9;Narrator; Wilkins thought: mom's birthday is coming soon.
intro_10;Narrator;I need to remind Kayleigh of this, let her at least buy a gift.

int_strange_painting_1;;The painting is badly worn, which is why it is almost impossible to make out what is depicted on it.
int_strange_painting_2;;But maybe it's for the best.
int_strange_painting_3;;It doesn't look like it was a good picture.

int_toma_tv_1;;The TV screen fills the space in front of it with a golden glow.
int_toma_tv_2;;Since it doesn't show anything, it works more like a lamp here than a TV.

01_secretary_fashion;???;...You can't buy such fashionable things anywhere now...
01_secretary_fashion_response_1;;What?
01_secretary_fashion_response_2;;How did I end up here?

secretary_first_meet_1;???;Expect to be approached.
secretary_first_meet_2;???;You can sit down for now... somewhere.
secretary_first_meet_3;???;Wait, did you just die?
secretary_first_meet_4;Gert;"My name is Gerta," she smiled and held out her hand to me, "Nice to meet you."
secretary_first_meet_5; Wilkins;Wilkins
secretary_first_meet_6;Gerta;To be honest, no one has been here for a long time. I don't even quite understand what to do
secretary_first_meet_7;;Herta started digging in her notebook
secretary_first_meet_8;Herta;Hmm...
secretary_first_meet_9;Herta;Hmmmm...
secretary_first_meet_10;Herta;HMMMMM!..
secretary_first_meet_11;;Then she picked up the phone and dialed the short number
secretary_first_meet_12;Herta;Boss, we have a man in the waiting room, says he died recently.
secretary_first_meet_13;Wilkins;(Actually, I didn't say that. I would also like to figure out for myself whether I'm dead or not)
secretary_first_meet_14;Gert;...
secretary_first_meet_15;Gert;Are you sure? This is too much...
secretary_first_meet_16;Gert;â€¦understood. I'll do it without sugar this time.
secretary_first_meet_17;Gert; And what should I do with the deceased?
secretary_first_meet_18; Gert; Understood, I'll tell you now.
secretary_first_meet_19;;She hung up the phone and turned to me again with a smile
secretary_first_meet_20;Herta;The boss said to give you to him. You're in luck!
secretary_first_meet_21;Gerta; Don't worry, you'll like him. Of course, he can be too loud and active, but this is even better.
secretary_first_meet_22;Gerta; Otherwise there is always such a deathly silence.
secretary_first_meet_23;Gert;Coffin, got it?)
secretary_first_meet_24; Gert; Go out the door right behind me and immediately to the right, to the end of the corridor.
secretary_first_meet_25;Gert;There is a sign on the door that says, you will not miss
secretary_first_meet_26;Gerta; Come on! Don't be sad!)
